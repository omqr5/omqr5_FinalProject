# Metadata and Privacy

Metadata can expose sensitive personal details - even if the file content seems harmless.

## Privacy Risks
- Reveals your **location** through GPS tags  
- Tracks your device type, software, and history  
- Links content back to the same device or user  
- May show edit history or deleted information  
- Can help identify a person even under different usernames

Platforms like social media sometimes **strip metadata automatically**, but not always.

## How to Protect Your Metadata
- Turn off **location services** before taking photos  
- Remove hidden data before sharing files  
- Adjust **privacy settings** on phones, apps, and social media  
- Use metadata-removal tools when needed

## Metadata in Investigations
In digital forensics, metadata is used to:
- Verify authenticity  
- Trace origin of files  
- Reconstruct timelines  

This makes metadata powerful — and potentially risky.
